          zAcademy fellowships are not introductory programs to software
          auditing. They are trial-by-fire programs where you will audit
          pre-production or in-production codebases, and the stakes are very
          high.

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              You will be auditing alongside our residents, guest auditors, and
              mentors.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              You will be expected to participate, add value to the discussions,
              and submit reports.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              You will be expected to be fluent at setting up test environments,
              and running common tools.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              You are not required to have experience in auditing in the Web3
              space, but you must be proficient in software engineering
              generally and have published proof of technical work. Please note
              that as the zAcademy fellowship continues getting more popular,
              the competition to join our programs is increasing with each
              iteration.
